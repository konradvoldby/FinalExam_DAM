About This Repository

This repository contains weekly assignments and the final project for the course Digital Archives and Methods (DAM), Spring 2026 at Aarhus University. The course introduces history students to digital archives and computational methods for historical research, covering the full digital lifecycle — from data collection and wrangling to analysis, visualisation, and FAIR data stewardship.

Final Project

Title: Sterilization by Design: Gender, Class, and Legislative Intent at the Keller Institution 1930–1943

Research question: To what extent did the introduction of the 1934 Sterilization Act systematically target women and lower social classes at the Keller Institutions for the feebleminded in the years 1930–1943?

Summary:
This project investigates Danish sterilisation practice following the sterilisation laws of 1929, 1934, and 1935, using digitised archival records from the Keller institutions accessed via kilderne.dk. The dataset contains 500 individual sterilisation and castration records (1930–1943) spanning variables including gender, year of birth, social class, legal basis, and legitimacy of birth. The analysis is conducted in R using tidyverse, ggplot2, and patchwork, producing five figures that together form the empirical basis for the findings.

Key findings:

Women consistently accounted for the majority of procedures across all three legislative frameworks, and their overrepresentation intensified following the 1934 Act
The median age at sterilisation for women dropped from 27.5 to 23 years after 1934, concentrating procedures within the reproductive years
Approximately 70% of all sterilised individuals belonged to the working class (Group B)
Group D, the most socially marginalised category, showed a near-total overlap with illegitimate birth at 98%
Data: Steri_fil.csv — 500 observations, 11 variables, sourced from the Danish National Archives (Rigsarkivet) via kilderne.dk
Tools: R 4.5.2, RStudio 2026.01.1, tidyverse, ggplot2, patchwork, dplyr, scales
