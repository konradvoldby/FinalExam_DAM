###   GETTING STARTED WITH LEAFLET Konrad and Kasper 

# Try to work through down this script, observing what happens in the plotting pane. There are three
# initial example exercises, followed by a few questions and 5 tasks. 

# Review favorite backgrounds in:
# https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/
# beware that some need extra options specified

# To install Leaflet package, run this command at your R prompt:
 #install.packages("leaflet")

# To be able to save your map, uncomment and install one of these packages. 
# If htmlwidget does not work, consider installing "htmltools" instead.
#install.packages("htmlwidget")
#install.packages("htmltools")


# Activate the library
library(leaflet)
# uncomment and activate whichever one worked for you to install
# only needed for saving the map as .html
library(htmltools)
library(htmlwidgets) 
library(tidyverse)

########## Example 1: create a Leaflet map of Europe with addAwesomeMarkers() 

# Learn to create a map by plotting three point markers, called Robin, Jakub and Jannes.

# First, create labels for your points
popup = c("Robin", "Jakub", "Jannes")

# Next, you create a Leaflet map with these basic steps: 
# call the leaflet() function and pipe in some background maps ("tiles"), 
# and then addMarker() function with longitude and latitude.
# Run the pipeline below to see the result:
leaflet() %>%                                 # create a map widget by calling the leaflet library
  addProviderTiles("Esri.WorldPhysical") %>%  # add Esri World Physical map tiles explicitly
  addAwesomeMarkers(lng = c(-3, 23, 11),      # add point markers specified with longitude for 3 points
                    lat = c(52, 53, 49),      # and latitude for 3 points (coordinates fall in EU)
                    popup = popup)            # specify labels for points, which will appear if you click on the point in the map

########### Example 2: create a Leaflet map of Sydney with the setView() function 

# Note that there are no points or markers below, just background tiles. setView() function
# alone helps you focus and zoom the map in a particular area of the world.

# Now we are in Sydney
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%                              # add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addProviderTiles("Esri.WorldImagery",       # add custom Esri World Physical map tiles
                   options = providerTileOptions(opacity=0.5)) %>%     # make the Esri tile transparent
  setView(lng = 151.105006, lat = -33.8767231, zoom = 12)              # set the location of the map 
# Question 1: What is the order of longitude and latitude in the setView() function?

#Answer: The order is longitude first, then latitude.

# Now let's go back to Europe again
# When the map defined below renders, click the box in top right corner
# in your map Viewer to select between different background layers

leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  setView( lng = 2.34, lat = 48.85, zoom = 16.5 ) %>%  # let's use setView to navigate to our area
  addProviderTiles("Esri.WorldPhysical", group = "Physical") %>%  # add physical background
  addProviderTiles("Esri.WorldImagery", group = "Aerial") %>%  # add satellite image
  addProviderTiles("MtbMap", group = "Geo") %>%               # add geomorphic units map
    
addLayersControl(                                 # we are adding layers control to the maps
  baseGroups = c("Geo","Aerial", "Physical"),
  options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = F))  # replace T with F and back and run it

# Question 2: How does the map above change if you replace the T in the last line of code above with F?

#Answer: If you replace T with F, the layers control will be expanded by default, showing all the options for background layers. If you keep it as T, the layers control will be collapsed, and you will need to click on it to see the options for background layers.
#Bonusanswer for shits and giggles: The place its set to is the Place de l'odeon in Paris, France.


########### Example 3:  SYDNEY HARBOUR DISPLAY WITH 11 LAYERS

# Let's create a map with more background layers that allows
# interactive selection between multiple layers. This can be useful
# if you want to rendering historical maps illustrating change over time

# The chunk below sets the location and zoom level of your map
leaflet() %>% 
  setView(151.2339084, -33.85089, zoom = 13) %>%
  addTiles()  # checking I am in the right area


# Bring in a choice of Esri background layers  

# Create a basic base map
l_aus <- leaflet() %>%   # assign the base location to an object
  setView(151.2339084, -33.85089, zoom = 13)
l_aus

# Now, prepare to select backgrounds by grabbing their names
esri <- grep("^Esri", providers, value = TRUE)
esri

# Select backgrounds from among provider tiles. To view the options, 
# go to https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/
# Run the following three lines together!
for (provider in esri) {
  l_aus <- l_aus %>% addProviderTiles(provider, group = provider)
}
l_aus

# Map of Sydney, NSW, Australia
# We make a layered map out of the components above and write it to 
# an object called AUSmap
AUSmap <- l_aus %>%
  addLayersControl(baseGroups = names(esri),
                   options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE)) %>%
  addMiniMap(tiles = esri[[1]], toggleDisplay = TRUE,
             position = "bottomright") %>%

                        var myMap = this;
                        myMap.on('baselayerchange',

                        })
                        }") %>% 
addControl("", position = "topright")

# run this to see your product
AUSmap
saveWidget(AUSmap, "AUSmap.html", selfcontained = TRUE)

#Homework starts here
########## SAVE THE FINAL PRODUCT

# Save map as a html document (optional, replacement of pushing the export button)
# only works in root

# You will need an html library to save pretty maps:
# library(htmlwidgets)
saveWidget(AUSmap, "AUSmap.html", selfcontained = TRUE)

########################################  TASK NUMBER ONE


# Task 1: Create a Danish equivalent of AUSmap with Esri layers, 
# but call it DANmap. You will need it layer as a background for Danish data points.

######################################## ADD DATA TO LEAFLET

# Before you can proceed to Task 2, you need to learn about coordinate creation. 
# In this section you will manually create machine-readable spatial
# data from GoogleMaps, load these into R, and display them in Leaflet with addMarkers(): 

### First, go to https://bit.ly/CreateCoordinates1
### Enter the coordinates of your favorite leisure places in Denmark 
      # extracting them from the URL in googlemaps, adding name and type of monument.
      # Remember to copy the coordinates as a string, as just two decimal numbers separated by comma. 

# Caveats: Do NOT edit the grey columns! They populate automatically!

### Second, read the sheet into R. You will need gmail login information. 
  # IMPORTANT: watch the console, it may ask you to authenticate or put in the number 
  # that corresponds to the account you wish to use.

# Libraries
#install.packages("googlesheets4")
library(tidyverse)
library(googlesheets4)
library(leaflet)

# If you experience difficulty with your read_sheet() function (it is erroring out), 
# uncomment and run the following function:
gs4_deauth()  # run this line and then rerun the read_sheet() function below

# Read in the Google sheet you've edited
places <- read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PlxsPElZML8LZKyXbqdAYeQCDIvDps2McZx1cTVWSzI/edit#gid=124710918",
                     col_types = "cccnncnc",   # check that you have the right number and type of columns
                     range = "DAM2026")  # select the correct worksheet name

glimpse(places)

places %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Longitude)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Latitude))

# Question 3: are the Latitude and Longitude columns present? 
#Answer: Yes, the Latitude and Longitude columns are present in the dataset.

# Do they contain numeric decimal degrees?
#Answer: Yes, the Latitude and Longitude columns contain numeric decimal degrees, which are suitable for mapping in Leaflet.Ans



# If your coordinates look good, see how you can use addMarkers() function to
# load them in a basic map. Run the lines below and check: are any points missing? Why?
studentmap<- leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = places$Longitude, 
             lat = places$Latitude,
             popup = paste(places$Description, "<br>", places$Type))
saveWidget(studentmap, "studentmap.html", selfcontained = T)

DANmap %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = places$Longitude, 
             lat = places$Latitude,
             popup = paste(places$Description, "<br>", places$Type))
# Now that you have learned how to load points from a googlesheet to a basic leaflet map, 
# apply the know-how to YOUR DANmap object. 

########################################
######################################## TASK TWO


# Task 2: Read in the googlesheet data you and your colleagues created
# into your DANmap object (with multiple background layers you created in Task 1).

# Solution

######################################## TASK THREE

# Task 3: Can you cluster the points in Leaflet?
# Hint: Google "clustering options in Leaflet in R"

#Solution below:
DANmap %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = places$Longitude, 
             lat = places$Latitude,
             popup = paste(places$Description, "<br>", places$Type),
             clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())


######################################## TASK FOUR

# Task 4: Look at the two maps (with and without clustering) and consider what
# each is good for and what not.
#Answer: The map without clustering is good for showing the exact location of each point and allows for easy identification of individual points. However, if there are many points close together, it can become cluttered and difficult to read. The map with clustering groups nearby points together, which can make it easier to see patterns and trends in the data, but it may hide the specific locations of individual points and make it harder to identify them.

# Your brief answer

######################################## TASK FIVE

# Task 5: Find out how to display the notes column in the map. 
# Hint: Check online help in sites such as 
# https://r-charts.com/spatial/interactive-maps-leaflet/#popup

# Solution
DANmap %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = places$Longitude, 
             lat = places$Latitude,
             popup = paste(places$Placename, "<br>",
                           places$Type, "<br>",
                           places$Description),
             clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())


######################################## CONGRATULATIONS - YOU ARE DONE :)
